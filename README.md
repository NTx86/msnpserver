# msnpserver
A server written in python for emulating MSNP

Currently its not really in a usable state and the code is really messy and unfinished.
It uses mysql for the database and it you can login using MSNP2 - MSNP7, add people(kinda), change your username and chat
This uses Microsoft MSNP2 documentation, Old packet captures and escargot packet captures
